Verification bounties can only be claimed by Grand Grove Badge holders

clips are by timestamp, not actual footage.

For all the clippers, each timestamp they capture that is used, the total reward is split between all the clips used, and then split between all the people who submitted time stamps.

Editing is compensated for compiling clips with good pacing, and tipped for making it a great consumption experience.

Streamers are compensated for streaming based on watchtime of the stream and engagement rate. Botting results in a negative badge.


### Actual Theory
Streamers stream
Clippers clip
Editors edit
Verifiers verify

I want streamers to be compensated for good clippable moments, but also for documenting the experience Live.

I want clippers to recieve enough compensation for it to be worth it. Or maybe they are paid in badges more than credits.

I want editors to be between "great pacing, not very flashy" and "that was engaging without being overwhelming". Compensated for pacing, tipped for flourish.

Verifiers are compensated for being non-biased verifiers. They are compensated based on their rate of good verifications.

Reputation should play a role here, where failed verifications result in hits to your reputation.
Perhaps some bounties are only available to high-reputation participants.
