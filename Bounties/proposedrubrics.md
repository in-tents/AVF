Community Validation Layer
Since robots can't judge true quality, add a prediction market:

Verifiers stake credits on their scores
Community rates final videos 1-5 stars after 48 hours
Verifiers whose scores best predict community ratings get bonused
Consistent over-raters or under-raters lose verifier privileges

Gaming-Resistant Elements

Randomized bonus criteria (this week +10 points for creative use of X sound)
Diminishing returns (same technique used repeatedly gets lower scores)
Cross-verification (multiple verifiers, outlier scores flagged)
Retroactive adjustment (if community consistently rates differently than verifiers, adjust rubric weights)

Edge Case Automation

IF artistic score >90 AND narrative score <30 THEN flag "style over substance" for human review
IF both scores >85 THEN auto-tip maximum
IF scores vary >30 points between verifiers THEN require third verifier
IF verifier consistently scores >20 points away from community ratings THEN require calibration
