# AVF

suck my fat throbbing cock petey

We test cybernetic governance in the DODM, and we test social dynamics in the minecraft server

We are also testing bootstrap methods

# ok but on a fr note
Edit: this note was not very fr. if you are more interested in mission statement, which is indeed fr, read on

The AVF exists because no one else will do it. So fuck it, we build it ourselves.

If I must personally shit Solarpunk into existence, brick by brick, I will. I can’t speak for my neighbors, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death. Please. I’m so bored at my job funding your yacht while I can’t afford rent or food. Fuck you personally.

Also: suck my cock.

Also: I won’t survive being a hippy in an authoritarian state. I’ll die either from boredom, or from doing something reckless to be not bored.

Which, I guess, is what I’m doing already.

The point: I fully intend to phase out AVF’s policymaking power over the Dartest Moon biz before DODM Phase 2.

My hope is to structure a living organism that governs itself effectively long after I’m marched onto a soccer field.

You can kill a man, but you can’t kill a raging moron.

Anyway, let’s be clear: Solarpunk is the end goal, but it’s not what I’m building. I’m building the bridge. The bridge to a life that plays an infinite game. I want to see the universe die. I want to be swallowed by the last black hole and spat out again, just to fuck around and find out all over.

I will learn the rules again.
I will paint the stars again.
I will make it mean something.

If I’m not meant to dance, why is there so much music?

So: Druidpunk. Technology in service of humanity, but with the honesty that humanity is its own worst enemy. And instead of telling that part of us to fuck off, we integrate it.

We give the ego something noble to do. A lie, maybe, but a conscious, social construct of a lie.

And it feels good. So you do it. Chase the dopamine, my friend.

When I say “Druids," I don’t mean magic. Druids can be anyone. I need everyone to be anyone. When I can draw on every perspective, I can see the full elephant we’re all fumbling to describe.

For normies, that’s just wisdom of the crowd.

For academics, like Stafford Beer, it's called variety.

Individually, we’ll be wrong. We must be wrong. But together we can step back, look at the bigger picture, and create a better physical manifestation of the conceptual model of the elephant.

But now that I can incorporate the magical perspective, perhaps I can better understand the face of the elephant. Maybe they are just seeing a much more detailed part. I dunno.

When I say they, I am not personally a practicing Druid, I cannot afford the membership fee, I am behind on rent. However I am a mystic. My journey was very personal, I still don't fuck with any magical frameworks, they all require a great deal of commitment and I am alergic to blind trust nowadays.

But I recognize the psychological advantages to participating in these frameworks.

I hope that I can match the variety of reality by exponentially increasing the variety of my leadership.

# Big Iron

Big goal, mini tasks

Member complete task, rewarded

Big goal completed, Big Iron rewarded

Big Iron use reward to create society for Member

Why?

I'm not sure but I think it's because we love them

Not like gushy love

But like "I love you the way I wish I had been loved"

ZHU says it best, it's just money and it don't mean nothing without you.

This is the time of the Darkest Moon, but I think it's just an eclipse. We don't have to start over.
